# Armstrong Numbers

An **Armstrong number**, also known as a **Narcissistic number**, is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

## Example

Consider the number `153`:

- **Digits**: 1, 5, 3
- **Number of digits**: 3
- **Calculation**:

  \[
  1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
  \]

Since the sum of the cubes of its digits equals the original number, **153 is an Armstrong number**.

## Other Examples

Here are some other Armstrong numbers:

- `370`: \( 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 27 + 343 + 0 = 370 \)
- `371`: \( 3^3 + 7^3 + 1^3 = 27 + 343 + 1 = 371 \)
- `407`: \( 4^3 + 0^3 + 7^3 = 64 + 0 + 343 = 407 \)
